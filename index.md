- Ph.D Thesis: Role of the Lebanese Druze Women in the Lebanese society post-Independence
   - In my Ph. D. study, I tried to convey the scope of gender injustice in Lebanon in general and in the Druze community in particular in the post- independence period by using mixed method of qualitative and quantitative research. The objective of my study was to analyze the motivations and implications of Druze women's roles on the Lebanese society. In the field of knowledge, I reckoned on the methodology of Pierre Bourdieu on his thinking tool the "habitus"; I explained how the genetic structure of the Druze woman's habitus became a "concrete ceiling" and acted as a hindrance to emancipate women from their traditional submissive roles despite the impact of the ongoing process of modernization in their community.
